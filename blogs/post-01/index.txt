(Learn more about these technologies by scrolling to our Section titled “Cookies,” “Pixel Tags,” and “SDKs” and How We Use Them.) We may use our own technology (as described in Client Services above) for that purpose, and we also may use third-party services such as Google Analytics, in which case those third parties gather information such as your IP address, browser type, the webpage from which you came to our website, and the times of your access to our Site. In addition, as you browse our website, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partners may then help us retarget ads to you on other sites based on your interactions with the Site. To “opt-out” of having your information used to tailor ads to you in this way, in this way, please scroll down to our Section titled “Your Choices, and Your Opt-Out Options” to learn how to opt-out of these services and instead receive generic, non-tailored ads.a:T4e5,Cookies and Pixel Tags. Cookies are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as (usually unique) tags that identify your device. Our servers send your browser or device a cookie when you visit the Site, and Clients and partners may do likewise on their websites or through their multi-site platforms. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access these web pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit and permit us to set or read our cookies. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device. When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a unique website visit. We (or partners we work with) may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you (e.g., when you visit the Site), track user trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ sites or interact with advertising. We use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests. We may use the following types of cookies:8:["$","section",null,{"className":"pb-[120px] pt-[150px]","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"-mx-4 flex flex-wrap justify-center","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"w-full px-4 lg:w-8/12","children":["$","article",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"mb-8 text-3xl font-bold leading-tight text-black dark:text-white sm:text-4xl sm:leading-tight","children":"10 amazing sites to download stock photos & digital assets for free"}],["$","div",null,{"children":[[["$","p",null,{"children":"Privacy and Cookies Policy\r\nThis Privacy and Cookies Policy describes the privacy practices relating to information that Easy Comment.
